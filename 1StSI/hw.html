	<h5>I am not sure about it's tuesday when read, but it definetely was when it was edited!</h5><br><h3> So, how about now?</h3><p> Could we just go on with some additional JoJo references?</p><h4> </h4>
        <h5>Of course!<br>There you go:<br></h5>

<ul>
    <li>Jonathan Joestar</li>
    <li>Joseph Joestar</li>
    <li>Jotaro Kujo</li>
    <li>Higashikata Josuke</li>
    <li>Giorno Giovanna</li>
    <li>Jolyne Cujoh</li>
    <li>Johnny Joestar</li>
    <li>Higashikata Josuke (not the same as the 4th. person) </li>
</ul><br><h3>My top 3 favourite members of the Joestar family are:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Jotaro Kujo, because he doesn't need to stop time to grab the shot bullet</li>
    <li>Joseph Joestar, because he has badass pickup-lines and he reads the manga from left to right so he knows his enemies' next lines</li>
    <li>Giorno Giovanna, because he has a very epic theme song
</ol>
